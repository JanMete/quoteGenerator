This React app fetches random data from an API and displays it in the container. Customers can click on the "New Quote" button, which will trigger another fetch. Additionally, there is an "X" button that redirects the user to X and prepares a post with the quote in the body.

for styling I used Tailwindcss together with SASS preprocessor and module css.

Libraries: Vite, Typescript, Sass, Tailwindcss
